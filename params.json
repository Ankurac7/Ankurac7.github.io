  "body": "### Welcome to Binary Blood\r\nBinary Blood, is a website project focused on creating single page speech based apps. We are students who are yet learning numerous things but are driven by passion to create something new and change the world. After all we do follow the words of our idol Steve Jobs \"People who think they are crazy enough to change the world are the ones who do\", who knows we might be one of these crazy people. \r\nWe would be highly glad if you write to us and review are efforts. Further suggestions are needed.\r\n\r\n### SPRES'eM\r\nSPRES'eM is a replacement to your HUMAN QUIZ MASTER. The original idea behind SPRES'eM was derived from the movie Harry Potter. One at times sees in the movie that the professors like McGonical say something as \"GRYFFINDOR GETS 10 POINTS\" now the question arises is that how something like that is being recognized. There's either some sort of magical stuff running in the back or some highly technical advanced system which understands the user's speech and does stuff for the same. So this is our try and trying to create something REAL. This is the first stage program that we made for out school's science display. The v2.0 as we like to call it is way more advanced and capable than this is and will be uploaded soon. â€‹",

<p><font face="indie flower">Dear Lavan, <br><b>*pause for a second for dramatic letter reading*</b><br>
2 years its been around this time when we really came to know each other. I still remember our starting group studies, karan ke papa wala moment, the time we disclosed our respective crushes (ooooooOOO), all those times in the complex when we would rest after playing the best one on one ever, and just talk like shit and predict our futures and BITCH especially BITCH about u know who(all). And especially the best basketball match ever, the game with the rain (We should call it that, sounds cool). And finally the past 3-5 months, have been something else entirely. All those nervous talks, couple of night stays, and just talking with you man has prevented me from coming in the morning news. Building spres'em alongside you, binaryblood, all those programs and everything, they would have been impossible if you werent there all the while. I mean EPOCH, BRAINWAVE, JIM CORBETT. I can go on and on. The list is never gonna end. Any thing with you is a memory I'll cherish forever.
You are a true piece of GOLD my bro (you thought I was gonna say shit didn't you). Anyhow here comes somethign special.<br>
<br>
 Another month or so,<br> 
 And ways we might depart.<br> 
 The memories I made with you bro,<br>  
 are some of the best from my past.<br> 
 <br>
 I dont know where we gonna be, <br>
 Or when we meet again.<br>
 But one thing I know for sure,<br>
 Nothing can replace u ever, NOTHING!<br>
 <br>
 You got the best jokes,<br>
 and an amazing dream<br>
 May it all come true, brother<br>
 Right now thats all I can wish<br>
 Love you Rahul! LOL.
 Sir, bas aur kya bolen. Padhte hain chal fir. BYE!
 <p>PS. A HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CO-FOUNDER! The best guy I know after the guy in the mirror. LOL. 18 ka hogya, ab ye bta Strip Club kab leke chal raha hai! hehehe.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-binary-blood" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-binary-blood" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Binary Blood</h3>

<p>Binary Blood, is a website project focused on creating single page speech based apps. We are students who are yet learning numerous things but are driven by passion to create something new and change the world. After all we do follow the words of our idol Steve Jobs "People who think they are crazy enough to change the world are the ones who do", who knows we might be one of these crazy people. 
We would be highly glad if you write to us and review are efforts. Further suggestions are needed.</p>

<a id="spresem" class="anchor" href="#spresem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SPRES'eM</h3>

<p>SPRES'eM is a replacement to your HUMAN QUIZ MASTER. The original idea behind SPRES'eM was derived from the movie Harry Potter. One at times sees in the movie that the professors like McGonical say something as "GRYFFINDOR GETS 10 POINTS" now the question arises is that how something like that is being recognized. There's either some sort of magical stuff running in the back or some highly technical advanced system which understands the user's speech and does stuff for the same. So this is our try and trying to create something REAL. This is the first stage program that we made for out school's science display. The v2.0 as we like to call it is way more advanced and capable than this is and will be uploaded soon. â€‹</p>
